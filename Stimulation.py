# The objective of this program is to load the details of the 200 people in the given data file. The data file         #
# contains the list of 200 people along with their friends. The idea of the task is to predict the spread of     #
# disease when one infected person comes in contact with another healthy person. For the given number of days and      #
# meeting probability and the health of the first patient, the stimulation for the entire set of days is calculated.   #                                                                                                       #
#                                                                                                                      #
# The second task of the program loads the peoples data as patients with the default health of the patient also with   #
# the first name and the last name from the inherited Person class. The actual stimulation for the spread of the       #
# disease is calculated with the help of meeting probability, no. of days and first patients health.                   #
# list of friends for that particular person.                                                                          #

# File Input Read: a2_sample_set.txt (Consists of 200 records of people with their friends list).                      #
# Task 2 Accomplishment : The task loads the details of the patient records from the a2_sample_set.txt file, using the #
# Person class inherited which was imported from task 1. It stores the Patient objects in a patient list with the      #
# default initial health. It stores the the first name and last name of the patient and their friends along with the   #
# default health.                                                                                                      #
# The run_simulation function creates the stimulation for the spread of disease for the days given with the meeting    #

# Terms used :  Meeting Probability : The probability for the meeting to take place between the two people in contact. #
#               Patient Zero Health : The Patient Health for the first record.                                         #
#               Initial Health : The initial Health of the other patients in the patient object list.                  #
#               Viral Load : Measure of the quantity of virus in the air which the other person breathes in when they  #
#                           are visiting and/or being visited by any contagious person                                 #
#               Health Points: Each person has a number of health points which changes over time depending on a        #
#                              personâ€™s health.                                                                        #
